                My name is Adam, a.k.a. 'Drummer Who Codes', and I am an aspiring front end web 
                developer. My preferred tech stack is MERN, but I have also dabbled in Django for 
                backend work. I am comfortable working in HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla Javascript (ES6) 
                as well as React. I am also open to learning new technologies as the job may require.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in simple, effective design and simple, effective solutions.

                For the last eleven years I have worked as a professional musician, but I am looking 
                to make a career change into the technology industry. My background as a lifelong 
                musician has taught me invaluable soft skills, such as: Perseverence, persitence, 
                communication, self-teaching, being coachable, and active listening. I am looking 
                forward to taking these skills, as well as my newfound tech skills, into a exciting 
                new opportunities.
